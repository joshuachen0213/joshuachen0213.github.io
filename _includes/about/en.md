Hi, I’m Joshua (Hsin-Jui Chen, 陳信睿). I am currently a student in the Department of Computer Science at National Taiwan University.

This blog serves as a space to document and share my learning journey throughout university. There’s still so much for me to explore in the field of computer science, and I hope to use this platform to record my growth and progress along the way.
