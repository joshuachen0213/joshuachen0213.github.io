Hi, I’m Joshua (Hsin-Jui Chen, 陳信睿), a student in the Department of Computer Science at National Taiwan University with a minor in Mathematics.

This blog is my space to document and share my learning journey through university. With so much to explore in the fields of computer science and mathematics, I hope to use this platform to record my growth and progress along the way.
