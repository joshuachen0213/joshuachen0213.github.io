### Introduction to Barycentric Coordinate
------------------------------------------

&emsp;&emsp;This [note](/docs/barycentric.pdf) introduces a simple yet powerful tool frequently used in mathematical olympiads &mdash;&mdash; **barycentric coordinates**. Barycentric coordinates are a type of homogeneous coordinate, meaning that the points represented by $[a : b : c]$ and $[ka : kb : kc]$ are equivalent as long as $k \neq 0$.

&emsp;&emsp;Barycentric coordinates are defined relative to a reference triangle. Suppose $\triangle ABC$ is a fixed triangle. For any point $P$, its barycentric coordinates are given by \\[ \left[\frac{[\triangle PBC]}{[\triangle ABC]},\frac{[\triangle PCA]}{[\triangle BCA]},\frac{[\triangle PAB]}{[\triangle CAB]} \right], \\] where $[\triangle XYZ]$ represents the signed area of $\triangle XYZ$.

&emsp;&emsp;Using barycentric coordinates, we can derive elegant expressions for various geometric properties and conditions, such as the equations of lines, the criteria for perpendicularity, and the equations of circles, among others.
