### Introduction
----------------

&emsp;&emsp;In my second year of high school, together with my teammate, we completed a study in the math department at National Tsing Hua University. Our chosen topic was nowhere differentiable continuous functions. We learned the following two theorems:

- There exists a continuous function that is nowhere differentiable.
- Nowhere differentiable functions form a dense $G_\delta$â€‹ set in the continuous function space $C[a,b]$.

&emsp;&emsp;To prove these two theorems, we had to develop some concepts from Analysis, and this experience sparked my interest in Mathematics. For further details, feel free to check out this [link](/docs/nowherediff.pdf).
