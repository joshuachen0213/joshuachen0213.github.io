### Introduction to Functional Equations  
---------------------------------------  

&emsp;&emsp;This [note](/docs/fe.pdf) introduces a type of problem frequently encountered in Mathematical Olympiads &mdash;&mdash; **functional equations**. A functional equation is an equation where the unknowns are one or more functions. For example, consider the following: \\[ xf(x + f(y)) + xf(y) = 2yf(x) + x^2. \\]  Here, the task is to find all functions $ f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} $ that satisfy the equation.

&emsp;&emsp;In this note, I provide a guide to help you become familiar with the common techniques for solving functional equations. Please note that the content is written in Mandarin Chinese.
