### Introduction
----------------

&emsp;&emsp;During the summer before my second year of university, I decided to take on more courses from my department in the upcoming semester. However, I was concerned about the increased workload, so I started by focusing on theoretical courses with a stronger emphasis on mathematics. I began preparing in August and gradually worked on these notes, though many parts remain incomplete. Currently, the [note](/docs/FLAT.pdf) cover only the section on regular languages and a small portion of context-free grammar, as the later topics proved too complex for me to complete.

&emsp;&emsp;For an overview of what the course *Automata and Formal Languages* covers, you can refer to the course description in my [course review](/2023/12/25/course-review/#自動機與形式語言). Please note that the content is written in traditional Chinese.
