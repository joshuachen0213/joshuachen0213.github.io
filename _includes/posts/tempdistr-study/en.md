### Introduction
----------------

&emsp;&emsp;This is the final project for the *Analysis* course I have taken in the Department of Mathematics. Our chosen topic is tempered distributions, a fundamental concept in abstract harmonic analysis.  

&emsp;&emsp;For this project, I studied *Functional Analysis* by Yosida and wrote a report on what I learned. You can find the report at this [link](/docs/tempered_distribution.pdf).
